# react-movies

Simple react based project, allow user to search movie information based on free movie api http://www.omdbapi.com/.
Main focus was to use react function components with react hooks insted of more traditional react components.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Not everyting was implemented. Movie detail page is not finished and reponsive view is still quite bad.
Unfortently lack of time didn't allow me to polish this application.

## TODO:
-improve design
-improve responsive
-better error handling
-finish movie detail page
-better use of material ui components and implement theme
-deploy production version, i.e. https://www.heroku.com/
